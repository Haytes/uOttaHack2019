# ChitChat

## Concept
ChitChat is an Image, Video, and Text sharing platform that utilizes snapchats self deleting content. 

ChitChat connects to SnapKit which allows users to use snapchat to upload videos and images to ChitChat

All content uploaded to ChitChat would be deleted after 24 hours

Users can tag their content using hashtags allowing you to search for popular topics and trends (E.g. #worldcup would give back all content with that tag)

## Features
- Commenting on posts
- Replying to comments
- Bitmoji integration
- Posts are similar to Snaps as in the have a life span 

## Tech Stack

## Problems Faced
When trying to use Snap Kit there was an issue with the usage of the applications page where we needed to connect the different developement kits to our application. It would not save our selection of tool kits or our list of demo user accounts. This lead to us being unable to progress further into the developement. With this issue and the struggle we were having converting the limited web examples of the Snap Kit Tools it made progress to be extremely difficult.

#### Landing Page

The "front" page where you see the most popular posts. You could search the posts based on their tags and their user. Potentially from here you could create your own post. This would either allow for a upload from your snaps or take a photo or video using your webcam and Snap Chat filters.

#### Post Page

The image is located on the left side of the screen and the comment threads are on the right. You can open to view all of the replies on a comment, reply to one yourself or make your own comment. There would be an option to use your Bitmoji's from your Snap Chat Account.
